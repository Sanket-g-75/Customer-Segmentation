Customer Segmentation 
---
# Project Description:

In this project, I executed a comprehensive Customer Segmentation initiative aimed at optimizing the performance of an e-commerce platform. Leveraging a sophisticated RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) Analysis methodology, I systematically analyzed and enhanced our understanding of customer behavior.

# Project Highlights:

## Data Exploration and Preparation: 
Embarked on the journey by conducting extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and robust data preprocessing. This foundational step ensured the quality and integrity of the dataset.

## RFM Analysis: 
Employing the RFM framework, calculated Recency Scores, Frequency Scores, and Monetary Value for each customer. This step allowed me to gain deep insights into their purchasing habits and preferences.

## K Means Clustering: 
Utilized K Means Clustering, a powerful unsupervised machine learning technique, to segment customers into distinct groups based on their RFM scores. This segmentation enables the organization to tailor marketing and engagement strategies to each customer cluster's unique characteristics.

## Model Tuning and Optimization: 
To further enhance the project's impact, integrated a Logistic Regression-based Classification model. By applying Hyperparameter Tuning techniques, fine-tuned the model, achieving an impressive Best Score of 86.1%. This enhancement enables us to make more precise predictions and decisions.
